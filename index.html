Visitors to China are often first struck by the sheer vastness and diversity of the country. Spanning over 9.6 million square kilometers, it encompasses a variety of landscapes, from the sprawling deserts of the northwest to the lush rice terraces of the south, the towering Himalayas in the west to the bustling coastal cities in the east. This geographical diversity translates into an astonishing array of natural wonders, including the iconic Yangtze River, the majestic Yellow Mountains, and the mystical landscapes of Guilin, which have inspired Chinese poets and artists for centuries.
